= Displaying Examples from JanetDocs
:toc:

== Status

In progress, but usable.

== Setup

* Clone this repository and cd to the relevant directory

* Ensure `janet` and `jpm` are on your `PATH`

* Install, e.g.: `jpm install`

* Obtain an appropriate `export.json` by either:

** Use the included copy for a test

** Fetching https://janetdocs.com/export.json[one] from JanetDocs

* Place `export.json` in an appropriate place on your filesystem:

** Copy it to `$HOME` -or-

** Put it somewhere and set the environment variable `JANET_EG_DB_FILE_PATH` to the full path it

== Usage

`eg/eg` is inspired by the built-in `doc` macro.

[source,janet]

(import eg/eg :prefix "")

(eg some)

should produce output like:
```
[1]

(some odd? [2 4 6 8 10])
# => nil

[2]

(some even? [1 3 5 7 11 18])
# => true

Total examples found: <<2>>

nil
